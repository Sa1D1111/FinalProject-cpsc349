With a deep understanding of somatic breathwork techniques, I create a safe and nurturing space for you to explore and release physical, emotional, and mental blockages. My approach is rooted in the belief that the breath is a profound tool for accessing inner wisdom, reducing stress, and fostering holistic well-being. Whether youâ€™re seeking to connect more deeply with yourself, manage anxiety, or enhance your overall vitality, I am here to support you every step of the way on your path to greater peace and clarity.
                    <p>Also currently honing my craft as a Computer Science student at CSU Fullerton. I'm a web developer, software engineer, and data enthusiast.

As I navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape, my goal is to harness these technologies to build innovative solutions that resonate with users and spark progress. Join me as I meld academic rigor with real-world application, all while championing AI ethics to ensure technology remains a force for good. Let's create, innovate, and elevate together.</p>
